This is Shree Siddhivinayak Ganapati Temple at Prabhadevi in Mumbai, a two-century-old Temple that fulfills the desires of the worshipers.

                The city of Mumbai is a mute witness to places of worship & historical interest, which are not only popular but also of archaeological importance.</p>

              <p class="lead">The city of Mumbai is a mute witness to places of worship & historical interest, which are not only popular but also of archaeological importance.
                    Arguably the most popular & significant places of worship are the Shree Siddhivinayak Ganapati Mandir situated at Prabhadevi. This temple was first consecrated on Thursday 19th November 1801, a fact that is noted in government records. </p>

              <p class="lead">The outstanding feature of this deity is the tilt of the trunk to the right side. The idol has four hands (Chaturbhuj), which contains a lotus in upper right, a small axe in upper left, holy beads in the lower right and a bowl full of Modaks (a delicacy which is a perennial favorite with Shree Siddhivinayak). Flanking the deity on both sides are Riddhi & Siddhi, goddesses signifying sanctity, fulfillment,
                 prosperity and riches. Etched on the forehead of the deity is an eye, which resembles the third eye of Lord Shiva.</p>

              <p class="lead">Yet Ganesha is traditionally regarded as the child of both Shiva and Parvati. In some parts of India Ganesha is depicted as celibate, but in others he is said to be married to both
                 Buddhi (“Intelligence”) and Siddhi (“Success”). Yet other traditions give him a third wife, Riddhi (“Prosperity”). </p>

              <p class="lead">he Gabhara (sanctum sanctorum) of the new temple structure has been designed with an aim to attain maximum convenience and comfort of devotees. It is a spacious enclosure with 3 main doors of about 13 feet height. This facilitates the ‘Darshan’ of Shree Siddhivinayak from either the area surrounding the Gabhara or the stage (Sabha Mandap) 
                constructed to conduct poojas and festivities, under the directivesof the Shree Siddhivinayak Ganapati Mandir Trust.</p>
